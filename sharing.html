        <h3>Our Beautiful Story ma</h3>

        <pre>
            Hello Ma,

            How are you? I hope you are feeling well. Wishing you many more happy returns
            of the day, Ma.
            
            I still remember our first meeting, Ma. We met at MGBS bus stand. You waited for me 
            for more than 2 hours because I got stuck in the bus.
            We both were eagerly waiting to meet. When I landed at the bus stand, you looked at me 
            and didn’t stop staring for even a minute. Your eyes said a lot that day. What you felt, I felt the same. 
            We both had waited for a long time to meet after our distractions.

            I saw the same Charan from our school days, the one who wanted to share everything 
            with her Akii, every time.

            <h3>Second Meet - Coffee Day</h3>

            It wasn’t much, we just talked about our lives, and haha, it was a funny day.

            After that, I didn’t meet you again. But you told me that if I am okay, we will marry.
            After much confusion, I accepted it, though with many doubts. Because of that confusion,
            I didn’t meet you much or chat with you, but you waited for me for more than 8 months and made me
            feel comfortable with you. 

            One day, you told me that you waited for me for many days, these 8 months, and since I’m here now,
            you will wait for me even longer,
            for my comfort, to talk and accept you.

            Yes, finally, your girl came to know that he is mine. Until then, she didn’t know, and she treated you as a friend.
            I’m so sorry for that. I always told you to wait because I wasn’t ready to marry or talk with you.

            From day one, you made me realize that you were giving 100% effort to show your presence whenever I needed it. 

            You know, Ma, when you see me like your daughter, I feel the same with you. Just pulling my cheeks and saying,
            “You’re not my love; you’re my daughter” — this makes me feel loved 100 times more. You are the best 
            gift to me, and you’ve held up to this promise until now.

            Even when I was angry, upset, or frustrated, you never scolded me. You taught me
            that I am your little girl. You made me realize that my approach was wrong. I listened to everything you said,
            and now, my introvert self has become an extrovert, only with you.

            You know, I don’t know everything, but you learned a lot to understand me and the world, 
            
            even things I didn’t know at that time, just for me. 

            When you teach me something, I feel like you are my friend.

            Haha, classmates, cycle mates, friends… >>> enemies… again friends… now one. 

            What a plan, #GOD???

            Yes, we are enjoying our lives happily. The day came when we discussed our two families,
            but it didn’t work out, so we stopped thinking about it. We stopped because of the same village, 
            the same families, and love marriage. But we didn’t fail to share our daily chit-chats.

            Again, we brought our families into our lives. Yes, it’s going well so far.

            Now, we’ve hit a broken stage. We added a lot of spice to our lives and started with 
            one big step. We both got disturbed a lot, but we came out of that, though it still feels
            difficult to talk on both sides. 

            The two months were the worst days of our lives. You remember, Ma, the things I said to 
            you, my thoughts were all about you. After everything I said, you swiped it out and didn’t
            swear at me. That totally broke me.

            But after that, you stood stand again and reminded me that this is our relationship. 
            We started rebuilding ourselves.

            Now, I was thinking about how I wanted our life to be, and you were the first person 
            I wanted by my side, the person who meant the most to me. But then... you said you didn’t
            want to talk much anymore. Yes, my heart didn’t accept it. My brain told me that you 
            weren’t okay with certain situations.

            I tried to understand, but it didn’t feel right. You took a stand again to talk to me,
            and we started rebuilding once again.

            Time became a support for both of us, but you said, “I’m fighting for time.” 
            I fought for time too, but you didn’t understand that. 

            Ma, I went to Bangalore and wasn’t feeling well. I pinged you with a simple "Hi," 
            and you replied. But when I asked you why you didn’t message me,  
            "I feel you only because I’m not feeling good.” 

            That day I remember, Ma. It felt like my last day with you. I cried a lot, sitting there,
            hearing your words about me. I know you’ve changed, and my heart accepted it, because i know ma 
            he is not my man he is someone i know the person who loves me alot  telling me not to cry. I felt like no one would be there with me.
            after crying a lot my eyes swell like baloons one person called my parents high fever 
            iam not able to open my eyes i suffered and depressed a lot 
            my father came and pick up i took biggest decision next day if i wake up i have to
            wake up without your thoughts i realised not intrested to talk with me now 
            not to see anymore after hearing all the words from you totally stopped even
            iam saying  let him go don't go 
            to his life again 

            it never stopped one time chepali ante ma inka neto matldali antene naku bayam vesindi 
            anta stage ki vacheasanu 
            because i know you are not the person who I know you are not the person who loves me 
            more than anyone in his life and he know me well 

            she is the girl never tried to talk shut even you don't now you crossed everything 
            totally the day is last day 

            neku okati chepana ma 

            nijamaina friendship enti nijamaina love enti anni neku telsela chesindi nenu 
            iam the one who stayed with you at your lowest times 
            i accepted your insecurities 
            at the end ..... all my fault

            But you never gave up on our relationship. Even though I fought, and you fought, 
            you were the one who took a stand to save our relationship, Ma.

            The next evening, what you said to me gave me hope to restart. 

            After I opened my WhatsApp and saw your messages.

            <h2>Ma,  Nana Vachadu, Mali Ninnu Baga Choosukuntadu Isari</h2>

            If you were with me that day, I would have hugged you and asked,
            "Where did you go? Why did you leave me like this? I have so many questions.”

            Those words gave me hope to restart with you, Ma. Until now, you are the same person
            I know. I’m sorry, Ma, for making you suffer iam so sorry ma. 

            We started understanding ourselves. Now we’ve rebuilt with a stronger foundation,
            not involving anyone else in our relationship. We’ve learned a lot from our failures.
            This was a big test for us, but yes, we came out stronger. Now, we’re together.

            You are the only one in my world now. Love you so much, Ma. In our life, 
            no disturbances should come again. If they do, we will resolve them without letting them
            exceed our limits. I promise you, until my last breath, I will be with you.

            Now, if anyone asks me anything, I just say, "He will take care." 
            I don’t want to overthink it. Thanks for being with me all the time.

            I realised how much importance i have in your life only i know what my person is 
            only i know what the person you are 
            

            Happy Birthday to my love.
